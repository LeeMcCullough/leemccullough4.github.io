/**
 * What is scoping?
 * Scope refers to the accessibility of a variable.
 * for example, if a variable is declared at the top of a class then it will
 * accessible to all of the class methods.
 * If it's declared in a method then it can be used in that method.
 */
 
/** What are the different scopes in JavaScript?
 * There are three types of scopes in Javascript.
 * 1) Global Scope 2) Function Scope 3) Block Scope
 */
 
/** What variables are bound to those scopes?
 * Global Scopes are variables that's not inside any function or block
 * or inside the global scope.
 * Local scope variables in the local scope are only accessible within the 
 * function in which they are defined.
 * IE/ they are bound to their respective functions each having different
 * scopes.
 * Function Scopes has a function that creates a new scope.
 * The scope determines the accessibility of these variables.
 * Variables defined inside a function are not accessible from outside
 * the function.
 * Block Scopes are a block scope that is in the area within if, switch
 * conditions or for and while loops.

/** There is a variable in the global scope and a parameter with the same name,
 * if you are within the function body which would you access?
 * If a local variable exists with the same name as the local variable that 
 * you want to access, then the global variable is shadowed. That is, preference
 * is given to the local variable.
 */
 
/** If you were in the global scope which would you access? Why?
 * We discussed 2 therioes about the global scope. One would be the therory
 * of the parent and the child. The child would have certain access to the
 * parents world such as the home, food and resources. The parent may not have 
 * access to certain things the child has and cannot reach into that world.
 * The other therory we talked about was the government(Ryan's favorite therory).
 * The president would have access to all the scopes, but a lower level
 * government employee would not have the same access. Global scopes can reach
 * in, but local scopes cannot reach out.
