  * undefined: A variable without a value. The value is undefined.
  * The type is also undefined.

  * Strings: A string can contain any number of characters, including none at

  * A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal
  * constant or as some kind of variable.
  * A string(or a text string) is a series of characters like "Lee McCullough".
  * Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or doubles quotes.
